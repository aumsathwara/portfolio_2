# Agentic Systems: The Future of AI Autonomy

Artificial Intelligence is evolving from passive tools that await human commands to autonomous systems that can understand goals, make decisions, and take actions with minimal supervision. These "agentic systems" represent a paradigm shift in how we interact with technology. Rather than micromanaging AI, we can provide high-level objectives and let the system determine how to achieve them through planning, reasoning, and execution.

In this article, we'll explore what agentic systems are, how Multi-agent Conversational Protocols (MCPs) form their foundation, and examine Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol as a critical advancement in this space. Whether you're a developer looking to create your first agentic application or simply curious about this emerging technology, this overview will provide the essential concepts you need to understand this transformative approach to AI.

## What Are Agentic Systems?

An agentic system is an AI-powered setup that can autonomously perform tasks with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional AI systems that execute specific, pre-defined functions, agentic systems possess several distinctive characteristics:

- **Goal-oriented behavior**: They understand objectives and can develop plans to achieve them
- **Autonomy**: They make decisions and take actions without continuous human guidance
- **Environmental awareness**: They perceive and adapt to their surrounding context
- **Planning capabilities**: They break complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Self-evaluation**: They monitor progress and adjust strategies as needed

Consider the difference between a traditional language model that generates text based on prompts versus an agentic system that might research a topic, organize information, draft a report, and even publish itâ€”all from a simple instruction like "Create a market analysis report for electric vehicles."

```jsx
// Example: Simple agentic system structure
class AgenticSystem {
  constructor(goals) {
    this.goals = goals;
    this.perception = new EnvironmentSensor();
    this.memory = new KnowledgeBase();
    this.planning = new TaskPlanner();
    this.execution = new ActionExecutor();
  }

  async achieveGoals() {
    const environment = await this.perception.sense();
    const plan = this.planning.createPlan(this.goals, environment, this.memory);
    
    for (const task of plan.tasks) {
      const result = await this.execution.perform(task);
      this.memory.update(result);
      
      if (this.planning.shouldReplan(result, environment)) {
        return this.achieveGoals(); // Recursive replanning
      }
    }
    
    return this.planning.evaluateSuccess(this.goals);
  }
}
```

The shift toward agentic systems marks a transition from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborator or assistant with increasing levels of independence.

## Multi-agent Conversational Protocols (MCPs) Explained

At the heart of sophisticated agentic systems lies the concept of Multi-agent Conversational Protocols (MCPs). These protocols enable different AI agents to collaborate, communicate, and coordinate their actions to solve complex problems.

MCPs provide a structured framework for interactions between specialized AI agents, each with distinct roles and capabilities. By breaking down complex tasks and distributing them among specialized agents, MCPs enable more sophisticated behavior than any single agent could achieve alone.

Key components of MCPs include:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Agent Roles | Specialized functions like researcher, planner, critic, or executor |
| Communication Schema | Standardized formats for messages between agents |
| Coordination Mechanisms | Rules for sequencing agent activities and resolving conflicts |
| Memory Sharing | Protocols for accessing and updating shared information |
| Evaluation Loop | Process for assessing outcomes and triggering improvements |

Here's a simplified example of how agents might interact within an MCP:

```jsx
// Example: Multi-agent conversation for writing a report
async function runMCP() {
  const memory = new SharedMemory();
  
  const researcher = new Agent("researcher", memory);
  const writer = new Agent("writer", memory);
  const critic = new Agent("critic", memory);
  const reviser = new Agent("reviser", memory);
  
  // Initial task assignment
  const topic = "Climate change impacts";
  await researcher.process({type: "research_request", topic});
  
  // Research results passed to writer
  const researchResults = memory.get("research_results");
  await writer.process({type: "write_request", research: researchResults});
  
  // Draft evaluated by critic
  const draft = memory.get("draft");
  await critic.process({type: "critique_request", content: draft});
  
  // Critique used for revision
  const critique = memory.get("critique");
  await reviser.process({type: "revision_request", draft, critique});
  
  return memory.get("final_document");
}
```

This collaborative approach enables complex workflows that mimic human team interactions, with different agents handling different aspects of a task and communicating their results.

## Creating Agentic Systems with MCPs

Building an agentic system using Multi-agent Conversational Protocols involves several key steps and considerations. The process combines architectural design, agent specialization, and careful protocol implementation.

### Step 1: Define System Goals and Agent Roles

Start by clearly articulating what your agentic system should accomplish. Then, identify the specialized agents needed to achieve these goals:

- **Controller Agent**: Orchestrates the overall workflow
- **Specialist Agents**: Handle domain-specific tasks (research, writing, calculations)
- **Critic Agents**: Evaluate outputs and provide feedback
- **User Interface Agents**: Manage interactions with humans

### Step 2: Design Communication Protocols

Establish standardized message formats and interaction patterns between your agents:

```jsx
// Example message format
const message = {
  from: "researcher",
  to: "writer",
  messageType: "research_results",
  content: {
    sources: [...],
    keyFindings: [...],
    relevantData: {...}
  },
  metadata: {
    priority: "high",
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Implement Agent Reasoning and Decision Logic

Each agent needs internal mechanisms for processing inputs, making decisions, and generating outputs:

```jsx
class SpecialistAgent {
  async process(message) {
    // Parse input message
    const task = this.parseTask(message);
    
    // Retrieve relevant knowledge
    const knowledge = await this.retrieveKnowledge(task);
    
    // Perform reasoning
    const solution = await this.reason(task, knowledge);
    
    // Generate response message
    return this.formatResponse(solution);
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Create Coordination Mechanisms

Develop workflows that determine how agents collaborate on complex tasks:

```jsx
// Sequential workflow example
async function reportGenerationWorkflow(topic) {
  const context = new WorkflowContext();
  
  // Research phase
  context.state = await researchAgent.execute(topic, context.state);
  
  // Analysis phase
  context.state = await analysisAgent.execute(context.state);
  
  // Writing phase
  context.state = await writingAgent.execute(context.state);
  
  // Review phase
  context.state = await reviewAgent.execute(context.state);
  
  // Revision phase if needed
  if (context.state.requiresRevision) {
    context.state = await revisionAgent.execute(context.state);
  }
  
  return context.state.finalReport;
}
```

By carefully implementing these components, developers can create agentic systems that exhibit sophisticated autonomous behavior while maintaining reliability and alignment with user intentions.

## Google's A2A Protocol: Standardizing Agent Interactions

Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol represents a significant advancement in standardizing how AI agents communicate and collaborate. Announced in 2024, A2A aims to establish common interfaces and interaction patterns for agents across different platforms and developers.

### Core Principles of A2A

The A2A protocol is built on several fundamental principles:

1. **Interoperability**: Agents from different developers should be able to communicate seamlessly
2. **Semantic Understanding**: Agents should share not just data but context and meaning
3. **Task Coordination**: Clear mechanisms for delegating and tracking subtasks
4. **Authorization & Authentication**: Secure frameworks for agent interactions
